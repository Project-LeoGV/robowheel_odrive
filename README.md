This repository will contain configuration files and nodes pertaining to the control of "RoboWheel" hub motors from [Sky's Edge](https://skysedge.com/robotics/robowheel170/index.html). specifically using the [ODrive](https://odriverobotics.com/shop/odrive-v36) brushless motor controller (anxiously awaiting the release of Sky's Edge [NearZero2](https://skysedge.com/robotics/nz2/index.html) controller!), and ROS 2.

Big thanks to Andy (check out his robot donkeys [here](https://hackaday.io/project/187319-robot-donkeys)!) for sharing his ODrive configuration.
